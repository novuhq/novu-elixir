# Novu

[![CI](https://github.com/novuhq/elixir/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/novuhq/elixir/actions/workflows/ci.yml)

An Elixir SDK for [Novu](https://novu.co/).

## Installation

Novu is available on [hex.pm](https://hex.pm/packages/novu). Just add this line to your `mix.exs` file:

<!-- {x-release-please-start-version} -->
```elixir
def deps do
  [
    {:novu, "~> 0.2.0"}
  ]
end
```
<!-- {x-release-please-end} -->

## Documentation

Documentation is generated using `ex_doc` and published to [HexDocs](https://hexdocs.pm/novu/readme.html) on new releases. This is automatic, so our only ask is ensure public functions have proper documentation and examples provided.

## Contributing

First off, thank you for for showing an interest in contributing to the Elixir SDK for Novu! We have created a [contributing guide](./CONTRIBUTING.md) that will show you how to setup a development environment and how to open pull requests.
